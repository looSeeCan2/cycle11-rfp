12/15/2022 /// everything is based on Henry's cylcle 11 react tutorial. I am not including the mui buttons

Created a new react app and deleted unnecearry files. I want to start using Henry's folder hierarchy. Then combine the coding with
    kevin tutorial(data base), then the other components that I have from the prisma project.

Starting at Henry's index.js    
    I installed react-router-dom: npm install react-router-dom.
    imported the necessary imports
    added the routes
    create Home folder , .css, .jsx
    created AboutYou folder, .css, .jsx
    
    Ok from here I have a Home page, AboutYou page and AnotherPage. In my index.js page I have to specify the route of the Page, then I 
    can Link to them.
    Im going to start writing the service.js and dbfiles for the database, I want to start with the Form, but, its on my work machine and I don't
    feel like rumaging thru github for it

service.js and db files from database project (coding with kevin)
    create service.js file
    follow notes from full-stack2 (coding with kevin)
    I'm having an issue with pushing the commit....Im using this as a test
